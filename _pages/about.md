Hi! This is Yuheng Zhu, a Ph.D. student from Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University. My current primary research interest includes Autonomous Driving, Sensor Perception and Trustworthy Systems. I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Man-Ki Yoon](https://mankiyoon.github.io/). 

Prior to my Ph.D. program, I obtained Master's degree in Computer Science from North Carolina State University. 

I received my B.E. Degree in Computer Science from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), and my final year project “A Fisheye Camera-Based Large Construction Vehicle Blind-spot Warning System” won the Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Qi Hao](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/haoqi.html).
